Project with Calvin, Lacey, Tom and Greg.


Our project is called Fair Weather Hiker. This application allows the user to input location and retrieve information about local hiking trails and relevant weather for that same region. The target audience is outdoor enthusiasts.

We are utilizing AJAX calls to the API hikingproject.com, and openweathermap.org. 
The idea is that when a user inputs the location of concern, then the same location’s weather is also retrieved.
This way the user may see a map of the hiking trail (possibly) and an exact position of the trail with further information such as conditions of the trail, how long it is, etc.
The weather API gives information of weather alerts, 5 day / 3 day forecasts, and current weather. 
*BONUS*
In addition to this functionality, to lighten it up, we would like to use the API untappd.com for locations of the nearest breweries.
The intention being that once you finish a good hike, you can have a blasting good pint o’ bitter.
Also there is the possibility of adding iNaturalist capability to the app.
